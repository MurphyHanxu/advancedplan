# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Notes

在当前文件夹hw3，`git bash here`

启动本地服务：`npm start`

react模块打包：`npm run build`



在当前目录下安装包：`npm install <package_name>`

上述命令执行之后将会在当前的目录下创建一个 `node_modules` 的目录（如果不存在的话），然后将下载的包保存到这个目录下。



如需删除 node_modules 目录下面的包（package），请执行：`npm uninstall <package>`

如需从 `package.json` 文件中删除依赖，需要在命令后添加参数 `--save`也就是：`npm uninstall --save <package>`

注意：如果你将安装的包作为 "devDependency"（也就是通过 `--save-dev` 参数保存的），那么 `--save` 无法将其从 `package.json` 文件中删除。所以必须通过 `--save-dev` 参数可以将其卸载，也就是`npm uninstall --save-dev <package>`
